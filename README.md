# ApiWithBasicEncryption
School assignment to make a basic api with domain and self created certificate. End point with SHA256 hash and assymetric encryption

# Encryption

The encryption examples are all made with a static string : "This is the message.", in regards to the symmetric encryption that also has a password, the password is : "myPassword".

Asymmetric encryption with public and private key. <br/>
- Very secure, but takes longer than symmetric encryption.

Symmetric encryption with public key and password.
- Less secure, but is faster than asymmetric encryption
- AES
- Password with Salt
